# coool
custom [Revolt](https://revolt.chat/) theme that wants to be like every other Discord theme 

mainly made due to being extremely bored and wanting to spice up the experience of a chat platform I use

> :warning: note that i'm *not* a css dev, or really any type of dev. i just look up the issues i have or how to do something then tape it together in a massive, ugly css file.

# apply
to use this theme, simply add an import (or copy paste the code) to the top of your custom css, such as:
```css
@import url("https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/sneexy-boi/dumpster@main/coool/coool.css");
```

recommended theme settings (for the default, anyways):
```js
