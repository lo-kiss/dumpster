# revolution
custom Revolt theme that is incredibly broken and a concept (for now)
mainly made due to being extremely bored and wanting to spice up the experience of a chat platform I use

to use this theme, simply add an import (or copy paste the code) into your custom css, such as:
```css
@import url("https://cdn.githubraw.com/sneexy-boi/revolution/main/revolution.css");
```
