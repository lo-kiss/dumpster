# revolution
custom Revolt theme that is incredibly broken and a concept (for now)
mainly made due to being extremely bored and wanting to spice up the experience of a chat platform I use

to use this theme, simply add an import (or copy paste the code) to the top of your custom css, such as:
```css
@import url("https://cdn.githubraw.com/sneexy-boi/revolution/main/revolution.css");
```

recommended theme settings (for the default, anyways):
```js
{"accent":"#c874b2","background":"#000000","foreground":"#FFFFFF","block":"#1D1D1D","message-box":"#000000","mention":"rgba(200, 116, 178, 0.10)","success":"#65E572","warning":"#FAA352","tooltip":"#000000","error":"#F06464","hover":"rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)","scrollbar-thumb":"#7b337d","scrollbar-track":"transparent","primary-background":"#000000","primary-header":"#000000","secondary-background":"#000000","secondary-foreground":"#DDDDDD","secondary-header":"#1A1A1A","tertiary-background":"#000000","tertiary-foreground":"#AAAAAA","status-online":"#3ABF7E","status-away":"#F39F00","status-focus":"#4799F0","status-busy":"#F84848","status-streaming":"#977EFF","status-invisible":"#A5A5A5","light":false,"font":"Poppins","monospaceFont":"Fira Code"}
